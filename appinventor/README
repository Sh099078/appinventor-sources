1. Compilation


2. Running Build Server


3. Create Components




1. Compilation:
###############

Compile project with Ant (works fine with version 1.10.5)


* Clean before building is advised as it remove already compiled files
  that you may want to compile a new version.

  > ant clean


* Always generate an AuthKey before building, otherwise you will face
  compiler error 

  > ant MakeAuthKey


* Build AppInventor, you must be in ${AppInventorSourcesDir}/appinventor
  directory.

  > ant

* Build only extensions, you must be in ${AppInventorSourcesDir}/appinventor
  directory.

  > ant extensions


These are the most useful build command. If you want more precise informations
about building AppInventor, you should look at root build.xml file.
(${AppInventorSourcesDir}/appinventor/build.xml)


2. Running Build Server:
########################

Build and Run 'Build Server', you should be in ${AppInventorSourcesDir}/appinventor/buildserver

  > ant RunLocalBuildServer

You'll probably want to maintain a log, and also run detached

  > nohup ant RunLocalBuildServer > ../../buildserver-log.out &


3. Create Components:
#####################

Python Script to create Visible and Non Visible Components boilerplate code.

run: python misc/componentcreator/componentcreator.py

PIL needs to be installed to resize icons automatically.

Windows users should install python before using the script.
